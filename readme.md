# Bot-Tom

## Overview

Bot-Tom is a discord bot that enables you to call your friends' emote usage into question.

All you have to do is reply to a message which contains an Emoji with the word "bottom" and the bot will generate you an image like:

![example output image](screenshots/bottomBean.png)

And it will send it as a reply to the **original message** like this:

![example usage screenshot](screenshots/bottomBeanUsage.png)

It also works with gif emotes!

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- A [discord bot](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html) with the "Message Content Intent" is required. Intents can be toggled in the Bot section of your Application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- You also need at least Python3.9 and pip installed.

### Usage

Required packages are documented in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and can be installed like:

```shell script
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The program can then be started like:

```shell script
python3 path/to/bottom_meme.py token
```
And replacing "token" with your bot token.

Resources for running as a docker container are also included.

## Known Bugs

- Flags are not detected
- Multi-emote combinations are [funky](screenshots/combinedEmoteFunkiness.png)
- Custom emotes are checked before default emotes
